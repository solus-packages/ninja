        <Summary xml:lang="en">A small build system with a focus on speed</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed. It differs from other
build systems in two major respects: it is designed to have its input
files generated by a higher-level build system, and it is designed to run
builds as fast as possible.
